#random images Build

when you enter any login details it redirects you to image, what about
if i make the image, random? 

it could be done using javascript n stuff.....

the `<form action="images/RNDimgPicker.html" method="post">` could look like this
and the RNDimgPicker.html `<img src="images/[javascript variable].png"> 
<script>[javascript generate random number and save it to variable]</script>`
also the random number could be like 1 - 25 and there will be 25 images each having .png extension and having their own number

i don't even know how to make that so can anyone help, i mean i know how but only in php
